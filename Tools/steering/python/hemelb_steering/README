Python module for attaching to HemeLB as a steering client

Usage:

Use one of the following executables:

* steering_cli
* timing_client
* steering

Usage:

<executable> [options] [remote]

If remote is one of the pre-defined remotes given in config.yml (Currently just localhost) then host, port, etc are taken from there.

Otherwise, can set the following options:

All executables:

-address <host>
--port <port>
--steering_id <steering_id>

--retry : if given, keep trying to connect until a remote is running there. (Default false)

== Steering_cli ==

Command line steering interface.

Extra options:

--monitor : show text output describing behaviour of remote (Default false)
--show : open local window showing streamed imaged (Default false)
--<any steerable parameter> <value> : set the parameter on connecting
 : list of steerable parameters is in config.yml

== Timing_client ==

Writes timing information to stdout, each time info is exchanged.

Timestep, Delta timesteps between lines, latitude, longitude,Time spent since last line, pixels in last sent image

Extra options:
-- orbit: keep sending orbiting latitude/longitude information
-- MaxFramerate <value> : throttle steering to the given max framerate.

== Steering.py ==

Is intended eventually to be the gui client. Just displays the image for now.
