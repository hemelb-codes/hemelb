    description: |
        Compiles and runs units tests for hemelb.
        The dependencies are obtained from another job.
        Since steering does not have unittests and since it prevents running
        multiple instances of heme on the same node (because port is hard
        coded), steering is disabled.
        Triggers regression job.
